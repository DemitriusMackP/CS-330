How do I approach designing software?
Software design approach is key to achieving your goal. I approach it by reviewing what is required for the task and then completing the task as described. 
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
New design skills include adding textures, adjusting position of meshes, and also changing sizes of meshes. 
What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed a creative design process and tried to think outside the box to set myself different from other classmates who may have the same work. 
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Tactics I used can be applied to future work by adding creativity to everything I create. 
How do I approach developing programs?
I approach developing programs by analyzing the code, and then moving accordingly. 
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I used strict measures to calculate the code and sizing of the meshes for my 3D scene. 
How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was applicable to process objects and running of the program. 
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My approach for the development of the code was thoroughly creating the code and making sure it runs bug free. 
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science helps me reach my goals by teaching me all techniques needed to completely program to my desired needs. 
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
This course helped me by giving me knowledge on things I can build upon for the future classes. 
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
This course helped me by giving me knowledge on things I can build upon for the future jobs and work studies.
